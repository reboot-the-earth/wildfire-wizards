# WildfireWizards

**Wildfire livestock evacuation system for San Diego County**

During the 2017 Lilac Fire, 46 horses died at San Luis Rey Training Center because evacuation was uncoordinated. Farmers didn't know which facilities had capacity, which roads were safe, or how to prioritize loading. WildfireWizards fixes that.

## What It Does

A farmer opens the app, drops a pin on their farm (or selects from at-risk farms), enters their animals and trailer info, and gets back:

- A countdown showing when fire reaches them
- A priority-ordered loading plan (which animals first, how to handle them)
- The best facility matched to their specific animals with live capacity
- Real road-following evacuation routes via OSRM that avoid fire zones
- A species-specific prep checklist
- A multilingual emergency chat assistant (English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Korean)
- Neighbor awareness — who needs help, who can help
- Proactive SMS alerts for registered farms (Twilio / Textbelt / demo outbox)

## Architecture

Five independent modules communicate through JSON contracts. No module imports another directly. The React frontend calls all backend functions through a Flask API layer and stitches results together.

## Shared Contract

All modules agree on these:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Coordinate system | WGS84 (lat/lon) |
| Bounding box | `north: 33.51, south: 32.53, east: -116.08, west: -117.60` (San Diego County) |
| Demo scenario | 2017 Lilac Fire, Bonsall area. Three pre-loaded farms. Fire from east, Santa Ana winds. |
| Communication | Every module exposes ONE function: JSON in, JSON out |
| Integration | Frontend calls all four modules through Flask. No module imports another. |

## Key Features

### Interactive Map
- **Pin drop** — click the map to set farm location; "YOUR FARM" marker moves with it
- **Farm quick-select** — choose from at-risk farms in the fire zone
- **Road-following routes** — real driving paths via OSRM, not straight lines
- **Fire heatmap** — density visualization with animated hotspots and pulsing perimeters
- **Neighbor awareness** — see who needs help and who's offering nearby

### Multilingual Chat Assistant
Built-in emergency assistant supporting 6 languages with keyword matching for fire status, farm risk, shelters, neighbors, routes, checklists, and contacts. All data strings (help messages, alerts) are fully translated.

### Evacuation Planning
- **Priority engine** — pregnant/injured first, sedation-needed flagged, trailer batching
- **Species checklists** — tailored prep steps for horses, cattle, goats, sheep, poultry
- **Triage warnings** — alerts when available time is insufficient for full evacuation
- **Live capacity** — facilities show available space, risk level, and trailer access

### Alert System (SMS)
Background polling job that watches fire spread, identifies at-risk registered farms, and sends evacuation plans via SMS. Works offline once the message arrives.

## Demo Flow (3 minutes)

1. **Set the scene** — Lilac Fire ignites near Bonsall. 35 mph Santa Ana winds.
2. **Show farms at risk** — 3 farms, 150+ cattle, 32 horses, 85 goats in projected path.
3. **Farm 1: Valley Center Ranch** — 150 cattle, 8 horses, one trailer, 3.5h to fire. System generates full plan with road-following routes.
4. **Show capacity impact** — Ramona Rodeo capacity drops. Next farmer sees different options.
5. **Farm 2: Fallbrook Stables** — 24 horses. System routes to Del Mar instead.
6. **Multilingual** — Switch chat to Spanish, ask "mi granja" — fully translated response.
7. **The stakes** — 46 horses died in the real Lilac Fire. This system makes that number zero.

## Tech Stack (All Open Source)

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion |
| Maps | Leaflet + react-leaflet, CartoDB Voyager tiles, leaflet.heat |
| Routing (map) | OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) for road-following geometry |
| Fire data | NASA FIRMS API, NOAA Weather API, LANDFIRE, USGS DEM |
| Geospatial | Shapely, NetworkX (Dijkstra on weighted road graph) |
| Road data | OpenStreetMap via OSMnx |
| Geocoding | OpenStreetMap Nominatim (forward + reverse) |
| Database | SQLite (alert farm registry) + JSON files |
| Backend | Flask + flask-cors |
| SMS | Twilio / Textbelt / demo file outbox |

## Setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd wildfire-wizards

# Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api.py                          # serves http://localhost:5001

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                            # serves http://localhost:3000
```

Optional — pre-download heavy GIS datasets (modules fall back to demo data when absent):

```bash
python modules/fire_detection/download_data.py
python modules/routing/download_roads.py
```

Run the test suite (60 tests across all modules):

```bash
python -m pytest modules/ -q
```

### Alert system (proactive SMS)

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap the SQLite farm registry (3 demo farms)
python modules/alert_system/seed_farms.py

# 2. Run a single alert cycle
python modules/alert_system/alert_runner.py --once --send-text-plan

# 3. Continuous mode (10-minute poll loop; Ctrl+C to stop)
python modules/alert_system/alert_runner.py --send-text-plan
```

By default no Twilio/Textbelt credentials are set, so SMS bodies are written to `modules/alert_system/outbox/*.txt` and logged to `modules/alert_system/alerts.log` (JSONL). To enable real delivery set `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` + `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` + `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, or `TEXTBELT_KEY`. See [`modules/alert_system/README.md`](modules/alert_system/README.md) for the full env var list.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET`  | `/api/health` | Reports which modules loaded |
| `GET`  | `/api/fire?live=true` | Fire perimeters + farms at risk |
| `GET`  | `/api/facilities` | Facility database with capacity |
| `POST` | `/api/routes` | Safe routes (`{farm_lat, farm_lon}`) |
| `POST` | `/api/plan` | Facility match + trip schedule |
| `GET`  | `/api/farmer-profiles` | 3 demo farm profiles |
| `POST` | `/api/farmer-plan` | Priority loading plan + checklist |

## Open Data Sources

| Source | What we use |
|--------|------------|
| [NASA FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/) | Active fire detections (satellite hotspots) |
| [NOAA Weather](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) | Wind speed, humidity, temperature |
| [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) | Road network + geocoding (Nominatim) |
| [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/) | Fuel type data for fire spread modeling |
| [OSRM](https://project-osrm.org/) | Road-following route geometry |

## Judge Q&A

| Question | Short Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| AI/ML component? | Simplified Rothermel fire spread model + decision tree priority engine. Future: train on historical fire data. |
| Scales beyond SD? | Architecture is location-agnostic. Swap facility DB and road network for any county. FIRMS/NOAA are global. |
| No cell service? | Plan downloads as offline PDF/SMS before dead zones. Alert system sends text plans that work without internet. |
| Open source? | MIT license. All open data: FIRMS, OSM, NOAA, LANDFIRE. Facility DB is community-contributed. |
| Can farmers use it? | 3 taps. Output is a step-by-step playbook, not a dashboard. Designed for a phone in a field. |
| Multilingual? | Chat assistant supports 6 languages. Farm data and alerts are fully translated. |
